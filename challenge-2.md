# 🪴 Challenge II: Create a Daap on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet


## Description: 
Create a Daap on the Polygon Mumbai testnet. (*Not to be copied from anywhere*)

## Rewards:
We can’t wait for you to complete this and claim, **your Special #BRC Tshirt [Top 20 Submission] 🖼️**

## Get Started 🏃🏻‍♂️ 

- Setup your testnet environment for Polygon Mumbai testnet.

- Claim some tokens required to work with Polygon Mumbai testnet [here](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) 

- Write a smart contract using Solidity, Or for more ease of use you can use the [Openzeppelin wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard).

- Now let's compile and deploy your smart contract using solidity compilers like [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) on the Polygon Mumbai testnet. (NOTE: You can use Hardhat if you want to as well)

- Once deployed head over to the [block explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) and let's verify the deployment and get all the necessary information for the submission.

- We'll need two things for the submission `Transaction hash` and `Contract address`

**Example:**

```bash
''''''''''''''''
 Your Code here

```


## Challenge Submission and guidelines

- [ ] Fork the repository [ we hope you did that already 💫] 

- [ ] Create a new branch (if not already created)  `username_BRC`, e.g.  `PriyathamVarma_BRC` [ we hope you already did this too  💫] 

- [ ] Now let's create a file named as `solution-2.md`.

- [ ] Now let's add the code for the smart contract deployed on Polygon Mumbai Testnet in `solutions-2.md`

- [ ] **[VERY IMPORTANT STEP]** Take the `Transaction Hash` and `Contract Address` and put it the Airtable form below with rest of the details.
